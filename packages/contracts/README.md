# Contracts

## Installation

Tooling required:

- [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry)
- Make
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (`curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`)

## Configuration

Run `make setup` and customize `.env` if necessary.

By default:
- `PRIVATE_KEY_LOCAL` is set the to the first Anvil devnet account (seeded by ETH)

## Makefile Commands

### Lifecycle

- `cd ../.. && make setup` — initialize libraries and npm packages
- `make setup` — sets up symlinks & copies `.env.example` to `.env` if `.env` does not exist
- `make build` — build your project
- `make watch` — watch files and re-run tests on temp local devnet
- `make clean` — remove compiled files

### Testing

- `make test` — run tests on temp local devnet
- `make test-gas` — run tests and show gas report on temp local devnet
- `make test-fork` — run tests and show gas report using `$(RPC_$(CONFIG))` as RPC endpoint

### Code Quality

- `make lint` — lint files
- `make format-check`- checks that the code is properly formatted, but does not modify it
- `make format` — formats code
- `make check` — runs `make lint` and `make format-check`

### Deployment

- `make anvil` — run local Anvil devnet on port 1337
- `make validate-upgrades` — uses OpenZeppelin Upgrades to perform checks related to upgradeability (automatically called by `make deploy`)
----
- `make deploy` — executes a deploy script to deploy contracts to the chain, with many options (env variables):
  - `$CONFIG` — the configuration to use (one of `LOCAL` (default), `TEST`, `MAIN`)
  - `$(RPC_($CONFIG))` (e.g. `$RPC_LOCAL`) — the RPC endpoint to use in the given config
  - `$(USE_FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT)` — whether to use Foundry accounts (otherwise, use env variable keys)
  - If using Foundry accounts:
    - `$(ACCOUNT_$(CONFIG))` — the name of the account to use in the given config
    - `$(PASSFILE_$(CONFIG))` — the path to a file containing the password for the account
  - Otherwise:
    - `$(PRIVATE_KEY_$(CONFIG))` — the private key to use for the given config
  - `$MODE` — one of `deploy` (default), `dry`, `resume`
    - `deploy` deploys normally
    - `dry` does a dry run (does not send transactions)
    - `resume` resumes the last deployment
  - `$DEPLOY_SCRIPT` — the basename of the deploy script to use from the deployment (looked in up `src/deploy`, defaults to `DeployL1Upgradeable.s.sol`)
  - `$(VERIFY_$(CONFIG))` — whether to verify the contracts on Etherscan in the given config
    - `$ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` — the Etherscan API key to use for verification
----
- `make save-deployment` — saves information related to the latest deployment to `deployment/$DEPLOYMENT_NAME`:
  - a mapping of contract aliases to addresses in `deployment.json`
    - The aliases are specified in the deploy script, they're necessary because we could deploy multiple copy of the same contract.
    - We also want to be able to map to a different ABI in the case of proxys.
  - a mapping of contract aliases to contract names in `abiMap.json`
  - a mapping of contract names to their ABIs in `abis.json`
  - `$DEPLOYMENT_NAME` defaults to `$CONFIG`
  - also reads `$DEPLOY_SCRIPT` and `$(RPC_$(CONFIG))` to know which deployment to save

Note that we don't currently support verification of contracts separate from deployment. This
requires knowing the constructor arguments, and these are not saved automatically — we would have to
log them from the deploy script.

To use Foundry accounts, run:
```sh
cast wallet import <account-name> --interactive
```

Then copy your private key in, set a password (don't reuse), and save the password in
`.password.local` (or any other file that you specify in `$(PASSFILE_$(CONFIG))`. Set the account
name in `$(ACCOUNT_$(CONFIG))`.

Full example for the `LOCAL` config with the first Anvil key:
```sh
cast wallet import test-account-0 --interactive
echo "password" > .password.local

# save in .env:
ACCOUNT_LOCAL=test-account-0
PASSFILE_LOCAL=.password.local
USE_FOUNDRY_ACCOUNT=true
```

## Dependency Management

Foundry dependency management used to rely solely on git submodules. These suck and I absolutely
refuse to use them.

At the moment, we use (p)npm to manage all dependencies, using the npmjs.com registry when
available, or importing from GitHub otherwise.

Foundry now supports installing without creating a submodule, as well as the [Soldeer] package
manager (which relies on its own centralized registry but also supports git dependencies). We could
consider migrating in the future.

[Soldeer]: https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/soldeer

In our current approaches, packages are installed in `node_modules`, so `make setup` will symlink
them out to the `lib` directory.

A note on [remappings](./remappings.txt) and these symlinks: we make sure that all libraries exist
under `lib` and that the contracts are resolved from their `src` directory.

This is because the IntelliJ IDEA plugin for Solidity will always resolve `my-library/Contract.sol`
to `lib/my-library/src/Contract.sol`. It understands remappings, but whenever the name of the
remapping clashes with a directory under `lib`, it will ignore the remapping in favour of the
directory interpration that requires a `src` component.

Foundry itself (as well as the VS Code Solidity extension) can resolve `my-library/Contract.sol` to
either `lib/my-library/Contract.sol` or `lib/my-library/src/Contract.sol`.

Note that when using remappings (For IntelliJ IDEA, when they are not ignored), no tool will
implicit search in a `src` directory unless explicitly specified in the remapping or the import
path.
